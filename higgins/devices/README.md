# devices

This module includes utilities for working with user input devices like the mouse, keyboard, camera, and speaker. For example, receiving input from the microphone and sending audio data to the speaker. There are no Actions here. The logic for "scroll down" would live somewhere else, like the `automation.gui` package.
